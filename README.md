### Hi there üëã

‚ÄúI am a confident, fast-working and attentive team worker who has the necessary skills to not only keep your organization safe from cyber-attacks but to also put systems in place that minimize risk whilst protecting your assets. I have excellent problem-solving skills, I can think like a hacker, my technical competence is broad, and I have excellent communication skills and a passion for continual learning and development. I am comfortable working with different computer and operating systems; I can troubleshoot quickly and explain situations in plain English so everyone understands; I am highly-vigilant and detail-orientated and I will always work alongside co-workers and people within the organization to ensure we stay ahead of the threats whilst eradicating our vulnerabilities and minimizing the risk. If you hire me in this cyber-security position you will be getting somebody who is totally committed to your objectives, a decisive decision making who puts the needs of the business first, and somebody who will always ensure their technical knowledge and competence is up to speed in this fast-changing environment.‚Äù
